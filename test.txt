We already know, how to use props to pass information down from parent to child. But how would we do the reverse? 

In order to propagate information in the opposite direction, we can send a callback functions as a prop from the parent component to its child.

This allows the callback to be owned by a different component than the one invoking it. 

Once invoked, the callback can send data to or change state in the parent component that owns it.
